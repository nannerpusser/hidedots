## DotHider

Simple script to detect dotfiles and dotfolders in ``cwd`` and set the hidden attribute on them. Does not do recursion (ie. Hide top-level folder only and not the contents), handles files and folders separately for proper use of ``attrib /d`` on dirs. Could be run as a scheduled task at start to ensure those dots stay spooky.

Personal use and mainly for the regex practice. 

## Installation
