## DotHider

Simple script to detect dotfiles and dotfolders in ``cwd`` and set the hidden attribute on them. Does not do recursion (ie. Hide top-level folder only and not the contents), handles files and folders separately for proper use of ``attrib /d`` on dirs, Windows only obviously.

Personal use, learning exercise, weak sauce. 

## Installation

None. Name it whatever you want.


## Usage

``python app.py ``
